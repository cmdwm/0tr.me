## Self Hosting
While I don't plan on providing support for self-hosting, I can tell you some basic things to get you started. This project is programmed in Node (obviously), with Express.js to serve content and qjson-db to store slugs. 

Just clone this GitHub repo, and download all the prerequisites. You can find them in `package.json`.  

You can spin up a free host on [Replit ‚†ï](https://replit.com) or [üéè Glitch](https://glitch.com).

### The .env file

The .env file has a few simple keys in them. You can rename these to suite your infrastructure better. Stripe information can be found at [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)

`wave` - Gradient information for wave gradient on home page, not required

`stripeApi` - Stripe.com API key for payments

`stripePriceId` - Stripe Price ID for Custom URL slug payments

I'm not going to include that in this project, but you can simply grab the code by viewing the source at [https://0tr.me](https://0tr.me). 

## Reporting bugs
It would be great if you could not only report bugs you find (by opening an issue), but create a pull request that helps solve it too. If you contribute, you'll be listed on the homepage forever.
