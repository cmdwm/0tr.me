## Self Hosting
While I don't plan on providing support for self-hosting, I can tell you some basic things to get you started. This project is programmed in Node (obviously), with Express.js to serve content and qjson-db to store slugs. 

> Interested in using a free custom domain with 0tr.me? See [this section](https://0tr.me/#custom-domain) for instructions.

Just clone this GitHub repo, and download all the prerequisites. You can find them in `package.json`. You can spin up a free host on [Replit ‚†ï](https://replit.com) or [üéè Glitch](https://glitch.com). Our main instance of 0tr.me is powered by [‚ö°Ô∏è GalaxyGate](https://galaxygate.net).

* **Important note:** You'll notice our public stats may seem falsely inflated. This is due to us not programatically counting analytics about 9 months after launch. You'll want to remove the inflation when selfhosting for an accurate count.

### The .env file

The .env file has a few simple keys in them. You can rename these to suite your infrastructure better. Stripe information can be found at [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)

`stripeApi` - Stripe.com API key for payments

`stripePriceId` - Stripe Price ID for Custom URL slug product

`KINDE_SECRET` - Kinde.com Secret Key for user auth

`KINDE_ID` - Kinde.com client ID for user auth

Don't forget to exit test mode when you push this to production üòé

## Reporting bugs
It would be great if you could not only report bugs you find (by opening an issue), but create a pull request that helps solve it too. If you contribute, you'll be listed on the homepage forever.
