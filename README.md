# ðŸ¦¦ 0tr.me URL shortener

Hello world! [0tr.me](https://0tr.me) is a free, open source and lightweight URL shortener. It has support for custom domains and decoding short links to expose the long URL behind it. 

## How to self-host it
While I don't plan on providing support for self-hosting, I can tell you some basic things to get you started. This project is programmed in Node (obviously), with Express.js to serve content and qjson-db to store slugs. 

Just clone this GitHub repo, and download all the prerequisites. You can find them in `package.json`. Most hosts download them automatically.

The .env file has one simple key in it, used purely to save space in the project. It contains the SVG information needed for the gradient wave in `views/index.ejs`. 

I'm not going to include that in this project, but you can simply grab the code by viewing the source at [https://0tr.me](https://0tr.me). 

## Reporting bugs
It would be great if you could not only report bugs you find, but create a pull request that helps solve it too.
