# Express w/ EJS

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a simple templating language that allows you to embed JavaScript code in your HTML files. It is often used in combination with Node.js and Express.js to create dynamic web pages.

EJS templates are plain HTML files that contain special tags that allow you to embed JavaScript code. These tags are processed by the EJS engine, which replaces them with the corresponding JavaScript values.

EJS uses the following tags:

<% and %>: These tags are used to include JavaScript code in the template. The code inside these tags is executed, but the result is not included in the output.

<%= and %>: These tags are used to include the result of a JavaScript expression in the template. The expression inside these tags is evaluated and the result is included in the output.

<%_ and %>: These tags are used to include raw JavaScript code in the template. The code inside these tags is included as is, without being executed.

EJS allows you to use JavaScript control structures like if-else, for-loop, while-loop etc in your templates which makes it very useful to generate dynamic pages.

EJS is a very simple and easy to use templating engine and is a good choice for small to medium sized projects. However, for large projects, it is recommended to use more advanced templating engines like Handlebars, Pug or Mustache.

One of the key features of EJS is its ability to embed JavaScript code within HTML templates, which allows developers to create dynamic web pages.

With EJS, developers can include JavaScript code in their HTML templates, and the EJS engine will execute that code and replace it with the corresponding values, allowing them to create dynamic web pages that can display different content based on the user's actions or other conditions. This makes EJS an ideal choice for web applications that need to display data from a database or other source on the client side.
