# 0tr.me custom domain module
> *Hi, real quick - this directory is not automatically pulled from the most recent update of what's on our server. Any huge changes/bug fixes will be re-published to this directory but we won't update it for every change, due to the fact the infastructure it's hosted on is so large & complex for other projects.*

This module is for our custom domain system, it powers the DNS magic that lets you use a custom domain with 0tr.me. Self hosting support is not provided for this as it's very complex.
